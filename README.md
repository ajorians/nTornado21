The game Tornado21 for the TI-NSpire calculator

About:
This is a game for the TI-nSpire!  It works on the TI-NSpire CX CAS with ndless 3.1.  At this time I don't know about whether it will work on other models.  It is a card game where you have 5 columns and you place a card on a column.  If the sum of the column adds up to 21 (or there are 5 cards on a column) the column is completed.  You cannot go over 21 in a column; so if you have no where to place the game is over.  Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) count as 10.  Aces can count as either 1 or 11.  More details about the game below.  Try to get the highest score you can!

How to put on calculator:
Start up TI-NSpire Student Software or whatever you use to put it on the calculator.  Then just drag-n-srop the nTornado21-sdl.tns file into the application to transfer it to your calculator.  You have to have ndless 3.1 on your calculator in order to run it!

How to play:
Navigate the menu using the arrow keys (or 2,4,6,8 keys) and the Enter key to start a new game.
Use the arrow keys (or 2,4,6,8 keys) to choose which column you'd like to place the current card on.
Place the card on the column by pressing the Enter key.
Continue placing cards on columns; when you have no moves it is game over.  Hopefully you got a new highscore.  Play another game if you would like!

More details about the game:
This game tries to be a replica of one at games.yahoo.com of the same name!  There are many bonuses to achieve while playing the game.  Here is a list:

Deck Cleared            65              play all the cards in the deck
Cleared Board           65              clear all 5 slots in only 5 turns
Lesser Straight         30              slot totals: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 in any order
Greater Straight        65              slot totals in order: 16, 17, 18, 19, 20

Everytime you get a bonus a deck card will turn gold.  Everytime you clear a column with a gold card the score for that column is double for each gold card!

There can be Jokers!  Jokers complete a column if the total is 11 or higher; and make the column add up to 11 otherwise.
